## What is CrackedLyzer?
CrackedLyzer is the only app you need to know if your tech brain is terminally cracked or if you’re just *another* VSCode normie in the timeline. Feed it your Twitter posts and bio, and it’ll hit you with a brutally honest crackedness rating that spans everything from your Tool Maximalism levels to your Language Opinions. Whether you’re an Arch Linux enjoyer with unhinged posting hours or a TypeScript defender with Rust urges, CrackedLyzer has your number.

## Scoring System: How Cracked Are You?
CrackedLyzer doesn’t do boring. It scores you across four categories, each dripping with chaos energy. Every category goes from 0 to 100, maxing out where the crackedness is pure:

- **Tool Maximalism 🛠️**  
  Think Arch users, mechanical keyboards, and dotfiles riced within an inch of their lives. Get those scores high if "I use Arch btw" sounds like a normal introduction.

- **Brain Rot Level 🧠**  
  If you’re tweeting regex rants at 3am, using monads for everything, and casually rewriting frameworks “for fun,” this one’s all yours.

- **Tech/Yap Balance 🗣️**  
  How much are you really *about* that tech life? High scores mean pure tech energy, low scores mean you’re spending way too much time in the replies.

- **Language Opinions 🚀**  
  Are you a Rust evangelical or a JS/TS normie? Type system fan or a chaos coder? Time to own up.

## How It Works
Type in your Twitter username. That’s it.

**CrackedLyzer doesn’t hold back:**
- Each analysis spits out one sentence calling out your peak cracked behavior
- Followed immediately by four numbers. Those are your scores. Higher = more cracked, simple as that.
